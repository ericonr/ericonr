## Individual projects

- [AppPauser](https://github.com/ericonr/AppPauser): Go project on Linux for
  sending SIGSTP and SIGCON signals to a monitored application.
- [AppPauserRunit](https://github.com/ericonr/AppPauserRunit): Re-implementation
  of AppPauser, but using runit + shell instead. Much tidier.

  simplifying data processing after lab procedures, in Python.
- [generate-sb-efi](https://github.com/ericonr/generate-sb-efi): Python utility

## Contributions

  Portuguese translation and a small feature.
- [BMSpy](https://github.com/ericonr/BMSpy): Block-Model Simulator for Python. I
  contributed mainly documentation, as well as some utility functions.
